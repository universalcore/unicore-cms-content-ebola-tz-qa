The illness affects humans and nonhuman primates (monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees). The illness can spread to other countries if they do not take precautions to prevent it. Zambia has currently put up several measures to prevent the illness from coming into the country. These measures require your cooperation. \r\n\r\n",
